<span>1.</span> Download [latest release](https://github.com/Hyperfoil/Hyperfoil/releases/latest) and unpack it

```
> wget https://github.com/Hyperfoil/Hyperfoil/releases/download/release-0.6/hyperfoil-0.6.zip
    && unzip hyperfoil-0.6.zip
    && cd hyperfoil-0.6
```


<span>2.</span> Start Hyperfoil in interactive mode (CLI)

```
> bin/cli.sh
```

For our first benchmark we'll start an embedded server (controller) within the CLI:

```
[hyperfoil]$ start-local
Starting controller in default directory (/tmp/hyperfoil)
Controller started, listening on 127.0.0.1:41621
Connecting to the controller...
Connected!
```

<span>3.</span> Upload the minimalistic benchmark, doing only single request to `http://hyperfoil.io`, and run it:


```
[hyperfoil@in-vm]$ upload examples/single-request.hf.yaml
Loaded benchmark single-request, uploading...
... done.
[hyperfoil@in-vm]$ run single-request
Started run 0001

Doing one request is not much of a benchmark and the statistics above are moot, but hey, this is a quickstart.

Now that you know how to run a benchmark, let's take a deeper look into [single-request.hf.yaml](https://github.com/Hyperfoil/Hyperfoil/blob/release-0.6/distribution/src/main/resources/examples/single-request.hf.yaml).

```yaml
# This is the name of the benchmark. It's recommended to keep this in sync with
# name of this file, adding extension `.hf.yaml`.
name: single-request
# We must define at least one HTTP target, in this case it becomes a default
# for all HTTP requests.
http:
  host: http://hyperfoil.io
# Simulation consists of phases - potentially independent workloads.
# We'll discuss phases more in detail in next quickstarts.
phases:
# `example` is the name of the single phase in this benchmark.
- example:
    # `atOnce` with `users: 1` results in running the scenario below just once
    atOnce:
      users: 1
      scenario:
      # The only sequence in this scenario is called `test`.
      - test:
        # In the only step in this sequence we'll do a HTTP GET request
        # to `http://hyperofoil.io/`
        - httpRequest:
            GET: /
            # Inject helpers to make this request synchronous, i.e. keep
            # the sequence blocked until Hyperfoil processes the response.
            sync: true
```

In the future you might find [editing with schema](editor.html) useful but at this point any editor with YAML syntax highlighting will do the job.

Ready? Let’s continue with [something a bit more realistic…](0.6_quickstart2.html)
