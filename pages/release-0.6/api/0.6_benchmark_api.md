## Benchmark definition


This document describes the overall structure:

| Property                   | Description        |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ |
| name                       | Name of the benchmark, as later identified in the CLI |
| [agents](#agents)          | List of one or more agents for clustered runs. This section can be omitted in [standalone mode](0.6_execution.html#standalone-mode-with-cli). |
| [pre](0.6_controller.html#hooks)              | Hooks executed before any benchmark run starts |
| [post](0.6_controller.html#hooks)             | Hooks executed after any benchmark run terminates |
| [ergonomics](#ergonomics)  |  Utility options that modify scenarios |
| [http](#http)              | Configure target servers and HTTP connection options. |
| [phases](0.6_definition_phases.html#phases)          | List of [phases](0.6_definition_phases.html) in this benchmark. |
| threads | Number of executors each agent will use. By default it uses only 1 thread for simulating all sessions |
| statisticsCollectionPeriod | Each agent collects statistics and sends them to the controller with specified period. Default is 1 second. |
| staircase                  | This is a shortcut for linking phases into a common type of scenario, called [staircase](#staircase) as the load is gradually increased in steps. |

Besides these all the options for the `constantPerSec` phase type can be embedded into the top-level to allow [shorthand benchmark syntax](https://github.com/Hyperfoil/Hyperfoil/blob/release-0.6/core/src/test/resources/scenarios/shortcut.hf.yaml) in scenarios with constant load. In that case you cannot use the `phases` declaration, though.

## Agents

This section can be omitted in [standalone mode](0.6_execution.html#standalone-mode-with-cli).

Agents section forms either a list or map with arbitrary agent names and either an inline or properties-style definition:

```yaml
agents:
  someAgent: "inline definition"
  otherAgent:
    foo: bar
```

The definition is passed to an instance of `i.h.api.deployment.Deployer` which will interpret the definition. Deployer implementation is registred using the `java.util.ServiceLoader` and selected through the `io.hyperfoil.deployer` system property. The default implementation is `ssh`.

### SSH Deployer

`ssh` deployer accepts either the `[user@]host[:port]` inline syntax or these properties:

| Property | Default          | Description |
| -------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| user     | Current username | |
| host     |                  | This property is mandatory. |
| port     | 22               | |
| dir      | Directory set by system property `io.hyperfoil.rootdir` or to `/tmp/hyperfoil` | Working directory for the agent. All the required JARs will be copied there and you will find the logs there as well. This directory can be shared by multiple agents running on the same physical machine. |
| extras |                  | Custom options passed to the JVM (system properties, JVM options...)

See an example of ssh deployment configuration:

```yaml
agents:
  agent1: testserver1:22
  agent2: testuser@testserver2
  agent3:
    host: testserver3
    port: 22
    dir: /some/other/path
```

### Kubernetes/Openshift deployer

To activate the kubernetes deployer you should set `-Dio.hyperfoil.deployer=k8s`; the [recommended installation](0.6_controller.html#deploying-in-kubernetesopenshift) does that automatically.

The agents are configured the same way as with SSH deployment, only the properties differ. Full reference is provided below.

Example:
```
agents:
  my-agent:
    node: my-worker-node
```

| Property  | Default | Description |
| --------- | ------- | ----------- |
| node      |         | Configures the labels for the `nodeSelector`. If the value does not contain equals sign (`=`) or comma (`,`) this sets the desired value of label `kubernetes.io/hostname`. You can also set multiple custom labels separated by commas, e.g. `foo=bar,kubernetes.io/os=linux`.
| stop      | true    | By default the controller stops all agents immediatelly after the run terminates. In case of errors this is not too convenient as you might want to perform further analysis. To prevent automatic agent shutdown set this to false. |
| log       |         | Name of config map (e.g. `my-config-map`) or config map and its entry (e.g. `my-config-map/log4j2.xml`) that contains the Log4j2 configuration file. Default entry from the config map is `log4j2.xml`. Hyperfoil will mount this configmap as a volume to this agent. |
| extras    |         | Anything in this property will be passed to the agent JVM. |
| image     | quay.io/hyperfoil/hyperfoil:*controller-version* | Different version of Hyperfoil in the agents |
| fetchLogs | true    | Automatically watch agents' logs and store them in the run directory. |

## Ergonomics

This section hosts only single property at this moment:

| Property      | Default | Description |
| ------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| repeatCookies | true    | Automatically parse cookies from HTTP responses, store them in session and resend them with subsequent requests. |

## HTTP

All servers that Hyperfoil should contact must be declared in this section. Before the benchmark starts Hyperfoil agents will open connections to the target servers; if this connection fails the benchmark is terminated immediatelly.

You can either declare single target server (the default one) within this section or more of them:

```yaml
http:
  host: http://example.com
  ...
```

```yaml
http:
- host: http://example.com
  sharedConnections: 100
- host: http://example.com:8080
  sharedConnections: 50
```

HTTP configuration has these properties:

| Property          | Default | Description |
| ----------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| protocol          |         | Either `http` or `https` |
| host              |         | Hostname of the server. For convenience you can use the `http[s]://host[:port]` inline syntax as shown above |
| port              | `80`&nbsp;or&nbsp;`443` | Default is based on the `protocol` |
| sharedConnections | 1       | Number of connections to open. This number is split between all agents and executor threads evenly; if there are too many agents/executors each will get at least 1 connection. It is recommended to redefine this parameter. |
| addresses         |         | Supply list of IPs or IP:port targets that will be used for the connections instead of resolving the `host` in DNS and using `port` as set - `host` and `port` will be used only for `Host` headers and SNI. If this list contains more addresses the connections will be split evenly. |
| requestTimeout    | 30 seconds | Default request timeout, this can be overridden in each `httpRequest`. |
| allowHttp1x       | true    | Allow HTTP 1.1 for connections (e.g. during ALPN). |
| allowHttp2x       | true    | Allow HTTP 2.0 for connections (e.g. during ALPN). If both 1.1 and 2.0 are allowed and `https` is not used (which would trigger ALPN) Hyperfoil will use HTTP 1.1. If only 2.0 is allowed Hyperfoil will start with HTTP 1.1 and perform protocol upgrade to 2.0. |
| directHttp2       | false   | Start with H2C HTTP 2.0 without protocol upgrade. Makes sense only for plain text (`http`) connections. Currently not implemented. |
| maxHttp2Streams   | 100     | Maximum number of requests concurrently enqueued on single HTTP 2.0 connection. |
| pipeliningLimit   | 1       | Maximum number of requests pipelined on single HTTP 1.1 connection. |
| rawBytesHandlers  | true    | Enable or disable using handlers that process HTTP response raw bytes. |
| [keyManager](#keymanager-configuration) |         | TLS key manager for setting up client certificates. |
| [trustManager](#trustmanager-configuration) |         | TLS trust manager for setting up server certificates. |

### KeyManager configuration

All files are loaded when the benchmark is constructed, e.g. on the machine running CLI. You don't need to upload any files to controller or agent machines.

| Property  | Default | Description |
| --------- | ------- | ----------- |
| storeType | JKS     | Implementation of the store. |
| storeFile |         | Path to a file with the store. |
| password  |         | Password for accessing the store file. |
| alias     |         | Keystore alias. |
| certFile  |         | Path to a file with the client certificate. |
| keyFile   |         | Path to a file with client's private key. |

### TrustManager configuration

All files are loaded when the benchmark is constructed, e.g. on the machine running CLI. You don't need to upload any files to controller or agent machines.

| Property  | Default | Description |
| --------- | ------- | ----------- |
| storeType | JKS     | Implementation of the store. |
| storeFile |         | Path to a file with the store. |
| password  |         | Password for accessing the store file. |
| certFile  |         | Path to a file with the server certificate. |
