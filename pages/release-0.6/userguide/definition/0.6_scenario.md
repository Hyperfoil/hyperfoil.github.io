Scenario consists of one or more **sequences** that are composed of **steps**. Steps are similar to statements in programming language and sequences are an equivalent of blocks of code.

While most of the time the scenario will consist of sequential operations as the user is not multi-tasking, the browser (or other system you're simulating) actually executes some operations in parallel - e.g. during page load it loads images concurrently. Therefore at any time the session contains one or more active **sequence instances**; when all sequence instances are done, the session has finished and can be recycled for a new user. Most of the time the scenario will start with only one active instance and as it progresses, it might create instances of other sequences (e.g after evaluating a condition it creates a sequence instance according to the branching logic).

httpRequest is a **step**, it will be the same level as all the other STEPS.

```yaml
scenario:
- SCENARIO_NAME:
  (Optional - STEPS)
  - httpRequest: ...
```

Example: 

```yaml
scenario:
- queryFlight:
  - thinkTime:
      duration: 3s
  - set: isOneWay <- false
  - httpRequest: ...
```

## Sequences of Scenario

```yaml
scenario:
- SCENARIO_NAME:
  - httpRequest: ...

- SCENARIO_NAME:
  - httpRequest: ...
```

Example: 

```yaml
scenario:
- queryFlight:
  - httpRequest: ...
- bookFlight:
  - httpRequest: ...
- listBooking:
