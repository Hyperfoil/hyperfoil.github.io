## Basic

Every benchmark starts with these benchmark definition

```yaml
name: BENCHMARK_NAME
http:
  host: URL
  sharedConnections: CONNECTIONS
Phases: ...
```

* URL is the HTTP protocol and hostname of the Application Under Test (e.g. http://myapp.com)
* Shared connections are allocated at the start time by keeping a pool of memory and initialized for the Virtual Users (VUs). When the VU finishes it execution, this memory is reset and reused for another VU.

Example: 

```yaml
name: My_App
http:
  host: http://myapp.com:9080
  sharedConnections: 10
Phases: ...
```

## Multiple Core Support

* By default, Hyperfoil only utlize single core for the execution for experimenting & debugging.  For production usage, add the `threads` that matches to the total CPU core numbers.

```yaml
name: BENCHMARK_NAME
threads: CPU_CORES
http:
  host: URL
  sharedConnections: CONNECTIONS
Phases: ...
```

Example: 

```yaml
name: My_App
threads: 4
http:
  host: http://myapp.com:9080
  sharedConnections: 10
Phases: ...
```

## Private HTTP Pools

* To keep connection private to the session until the session completes and prefer these connection, use `ergonomics` with `privateHttpPools` true. (Note: session is a sequence of scenarios)

```yaml
name: BENCHMARK_NAME
threads: CPU_CORES
ergonomics:
  privateHttpPools: true
http:
  host: URL
  sharedConnections: CONNECTIONS
Phases: ...
```

Example: 

```yaml
name: My_App
threads: 4
ergonomics:
  privateHttpPools: true
http:
  host: http://myapp.com:9080
  sharedConnections: 10
Phases: ...
```

## Service Mesh - ISTIO Example

* When using a service mesh (e.g. ISTIO), Hyperfoil has to point to an IP address of service mesh gateway.  In this case, use the `addresses`:

```yaml
name: BENCHMARK_NAME
threads: CPU_CORES
http:
  host: URL
  addresses:
  - SERVICEMESH_GATEWAY
  sharedConnections: CONNECTIONS
Phases: ...
```

Example: 

```yaml
name: My_App
threads: 4
http:
  host: http://myapp.com:9080
  addresses:
  - 123.456.789.101
  sharedConnections: 10
Phases: ...

## Controller and agents

While it is possible to run benchmarks directly from CLI, in its nature Hyperfoil is a distributed tool with master-slave architecture. **Controller** has the master role; this is a [Vert.x]((https://vertx.io))-based server with REST API. When a benchmark is started controller deploys agents (according to the benchmark definition), pushes the benchmark definition to these agents and orchestrates benchmark phases. **Agents** execute the benchmark, periodically sending statistics to the controller. This way the controller can combine and evaluate statistics from all agents on the fly. When the benchmark is completed all agents terminate.

All communication between the controller and agents happens over Vert.x eventbus - therefore it is independent on the deployment type. (Currently only SSH-based deployment is implemented, requiring pubkey access to the agent nodes).

```yaml
name: BENCHMARK_NAME
threads: CPU_CORES
ergonomics:
  privateHttpPools: true
agents:
  agent1: TESTSERVER1:22
  agent2: TESTUSER@TESTSERVER2
  agent3:
    host: TESTSERVER3
    port: 22
    dir: /some/other/path
http:
  host: URL
  sharedConnections: CONNECTIONS
Phases: ...
```

Example: 

```yaml
name: My_App
threads: 4
ergonomics:
  privateHttpPools: true
agents:
  agent1: myagent_server:22
http:
  host: http://myapp.com:9080
  sharedConnections: 10
Phases: ...
```
