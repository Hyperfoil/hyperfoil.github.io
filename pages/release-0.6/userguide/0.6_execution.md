## CLI Mode

Start Hyperfoil in interactive mode (CLI):

```
> bin/cli.sh
```

Start an embedded server (controller) within the CLI:

```scala
[hyperfoil]$ start-local
Starting controller in default directory (/tmp/hyperfoil)
Controller started, listening on 127.0.0.1:41621
Connecting to the controller...
Connected!
```

Upload a benchmark:

```scala
[hyperfoil@in-vm]$ upload examples/single-request.hf.yaml
Loaded benchmark single-request, uploading...
... done.
```

Execute the benchmark:

```scala
[hyperfoil@in-vm]$ run single-request
Started run 0001
Run 0001, benchmark single-request
Agents: in-vm[STARTING]
Started: 2019/11/15 16:11:43.725    Terminated: 2019/11/15 16:11:43.899
NAME     STATUS      STARTED       REMAINING  COMPLETED     TOTAL DURATION               DESCRIPTION
example  TERMINATED  16:11:43.725             16:11:43.899  174 ms (exceeded by 174 ms)  1 users at once
```

Check performance results:

```scala
[hyperfoil@in-vm]$ stats
Total stats from run 000A
PHASE    METRIC  REQUESTS  MEAN       p50        p90        p99        p99.9      p99.99     2xx  3xx  4xx  5xx  CACHE  TIMEOUTS  ERRORS  BLOCKED
example  test           1  172.49 ms  173.02 ms  173.02 ms  173.02 ms  173.02 ms  173.02 ms    0    1    0    0      0         0       0       0 ns
```

## Standalone Mode with CLI

Open two terminals; in one terminal start the standalone server and in second terminal start the CLI.

&nbsp;

Start standalone:

```
> bin/standalone.sh
```

On another terminal start interactive mode (CLI):

```
> bin/cli.sh
```

Connect to the server from CLI (by default server is running on `http://localhost:8090`):


```scala
[hyperfoil@localhost]$ connect
Connected! Server has these agents connected:
* localhost[REGISTERED]
```

Upload a benchmark:

```scala
[hyperfoil@in-vm]$ upload examples/single-request.hf.yaml
Loaded benchmark single-request, uploading...
... done.
```

Execute the benchmark:

```scala
[hyperfoil@in-vm]$ run single-request
Started run 0001
Run 0001, benchmark single-request
Agents: in-vm[STARTING]
Started: 2019/11/15 16:11:43.725    Terminated: 2019/11/15 16:11:43.899

```

```scala

```

## Standalone Mode with REST API

## Distributed Mode

Distributed mode operates as a cluster of [Vert.x](https://vertx.io/). When the benchmark is started, it deploys agents on other nodes according to the benchmark configuration - these are Vert.x nodes, too. Together controller and agents form a cluster and communicate over the event bus.

In this quickstart we'll use the SSH deployer; make sure your machine has SSH server running on port 22 and you can login using your pubkey `~/.ssh/id_rsa`. The SSH deployer copies the necessary JARs to `/tmp/hyperfoil/agentlib/` and starts the agent there. For instructions to run Hyperfoil in Kubernetes or Openshift please consult the [Installation docs](0.6_controller.html#deploying-in-kubernetesopenshift).

When we were running in the standalone or local mode we did not have to set any agents in the benchmark definition. That changes now as we need to inform the controller where the agents should be deployed. Let's see a benchmark - [two-agents.hf.yaml](https://github.com/Hyperfoil/Hyperfoil/blob/release-0.6/distribution/src/main/resources/examples/two-agents.hf.yaml) that has those agents defined.


```yaml
name: two-agents
# List of agents the Controller should deploy
agents:
  # This defines the agent using SSH connection to localhost, port 22
  agent-one: localhost:22
  # Another agent on localhost, this time defined using properties
  agent-two:
    host: localhost
    port: 22
http:
  host: http://localhost:8080
usersPerSec: 10
duration: 10s
scenario:
- test:
  - httpRequest:
      GET: /

```

The load the benchmark generates is evenly split among the agents, so if you want to use another agent, you don't need to do any calculations - just add the agent and you're good to go.

All other operations are the same as [Standalone Mode with CLI](0.6_execution.html#standalone-mode-with-cli) and [Standalone Mode with REST API](0.6_execution.html#standalone-mode-with-rest-api)
