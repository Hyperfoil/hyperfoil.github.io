This script is particularly beneficial when you need to quickly test, validate or refine your benchmark definitions, ensuring they run as expected without needing to manually orchestrate the controller and agent processes. It also enables seamless integration into automation scripts or CI/CD pipelines, where you can configure benchmarks to run as part of routine testing, with results saved for further analysis.</description></item></channel></rss>
